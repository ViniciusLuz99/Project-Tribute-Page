# Tribute Page
 
- [See the result here](https://viniciusluz99.github.io/Project-Tribute-Page/)
- Description: This Tribute Page was created as part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. The project was designed to showcase my skills in using HTML5 and CSS3 to build a webpage that pays tribute to a person or entity. For this project, I chose to honor the legendary heavy metal singer Ozzy Osbourne.
The Tribute Page includes a brief biography of Ozzy's career in the heavy metal genre, as well as a timeline highlighting his most significant albums and collaborations. To enhance the user experience, I also added a Spotify playlist featuring some of Ozzy's most iconic songs, allowing visitors to listen to his music while exploring the tribute page.
